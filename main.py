"""
this is the entrypoint. where you should start the program.r

in this file there are couple things to do before do the real job (submit start and end of working day to karsu)

before submit we need to make sure that today is not thursday or friday. because in Iran these days are off.

after that the event should be found. events can be start of day or end of day. according to what hour is now we're
deciding that the record should be send for start of day or end of it.

whenever hour equals to 10 it's an start day event, and 18 is sign of end of the working day.
